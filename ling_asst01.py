Complete the function `mean` for calculating the mean (average) of a
list of numeric values. Your function should take a list vals as its
argument and return a float.

In class, we wrote this with a for-loop. Consider doing it instead with
the in-line function `sum`, which facilitates a fast and readable
one-line version of the function.

Complete the function `sd` for calculating the standard deviation of a
list of numeric values. Your function should take a list of ints or
floats as its value and return a float.

For details on calculating the standard deviation, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation

I suggest using `len(vals)-1` for the denominator, but `len(vals)` is
fine. (An optional, advanced approach is to have an optional function
argument `sd_corr=1` that puts this correction under the user's
control, but don't worry about this if you don't already know about
optional arguments.)

To get the square root of a float `x`, use
math.sqrt(x)

palindrome).
